## ❓About Me❓
I have a strong ambition to make the switch to tech, I have a curious mindset, a willingness to learn, adaptability, and the ability to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, GIT and Github. I have touched upon JQuery, Python, Node and React. I am continuously improving and adding to my skill base via online courses and coding challenges. I have been very fortunate to place in the final 3 in some of the code first girls challenges both of these utilising some of my strengths, namely creativity, thinking outside of the box and my ability to hyperfocus for extended periods.
<hr>
I'm a disability advocate, I myself am disabled (neurodiverse) and so is my daughter and many family members. Creating a better world for the next generation of neurodiverse people is something I feel strongly about. I volunteer for a local charity, helping parents navigate their way through various systems that are not geared up for disabled children (schools, hospitals, activities etc). I also have regular meetings with local government groups, NHS groups, mental health departments/charities etc to try and help them make things better for disabled people (particularly children). <br>
<br>
I'm also a frequent research participant, helping medical professionals understand more about neurodiversity and enabling them to create better screening tools/assessments and offer better levels of help.
<hr>
I love to game, if I'm not coding then I'm gaming, I love all types of games from Gears of war and Halo to Mario and the Sims. <br>
<br>
I love animals and currently have 2 dogs, 2 cats and 2 snakes. Dog walking is great exercise but I always seem to have my aha moments then, stuck on a tricky bit of code, 9 times out of 10 the solution usually comes to me when I'm 2 miles from the house and can't test it out!
