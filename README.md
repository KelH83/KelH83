## ❓About Me❓
As I embark on transitioning into the tech industry, I bring a diverse skill set spanning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, Jest, Express.js, Axios, Vite, Wave, and API development. With a lifelong passion for technology and web design deeply ingrained in my upbringing, I am eager to pursue my first role in the tech world.

From an early age, I shared a bond with technology, helping my dad build desktop computers and delving into the intricacies of hardware and software. This early exposure ignited a fervent interest in problem-solving and innovation, laying the foundation for my lifelong interest in tech and software development.

Proficient in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I possess hands-on experience crafting intuitive user interfaces and dynamic web applications using React. With a solid understanding of backend development, I excel in leveraging Node.js and Express.js to build robust APIs, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend systems.

Additionally, I ensure efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms using PostgreSQL, my knowledge in version control with Git and GitHub enables effective collaboration within Agile methodologies, delivering high-quality software products.

Utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design, Jest for comprehensive unit testing, and Axios for handling HTTP requests, I prioritize code integrity and optimal performance in my projects. My dedication to accessibility is evident in my utilization of Wave,Axe and Lighthouse for building inclusive web applications.
<hr>
I'm a disability advocate, I myself am disabled (neurodiverse) and so is my daughter and many family members. Creating a better world for the next generation of neurodiverse people is something I feel strongly about. I volunteer for a local charity, helping parents navigate their way through various systems that are not geared up for disabled children (schools, hospitals, activities etc). I also have regular meetings with local government groups, NHS groups, mental health departments/charities etc to try and help them make things better for disabled people (particularly children). <br>
<br>
I'm also a frequent research participant, helping medical professionals understand more about neurodiversity and enabling them to create better screening tools/assessments and offer better levels of help.
