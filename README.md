# Hello, I'm Kelly 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻

## ❓About Me❓
I am currently re-training as a software developer with a keen interest in full-stack development. I have trained to a good standard in basic web development - HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as touched on bootstrap and Python. I am working my way through the full-stack pathway on Codecademy as well as undertaking multiple coding courses with Code First Girls and Udemy. I love all things tech and I'm so excited for what the future holds, what a time to be alive!
<hr>
I'm a disability advocate, I myself am disabled (neurodiverse) and so is my daughter and many family members. Creating a better world for the next generation of neurodiverse people is something I feel strongly about. I volunteer for a local charity, helping parents navigate their way through various systems that are not geared up for disabled children (schools, hospitals, activities etc). I also have regular meetings with local government groups, NHS groups, mental health departments/charities etc to try and help them make things better for disabled people (particularly children). <br>
<br>
I'm also a frequent research participant, helping medical professionals understand more about neurodiversity and enabling them to create better screening tools/assessments and offer better levels of help.
<hr>
I love to game, if I'm not coding then I'm gaming, I love all types of games from Gears of war and Halo to Mario and the Sims. <br>
<br>
I love animals and currently have 2 dogs, 2 cats and 2 snakes. Dog walking is great exercise but I always seem to have my aha moments then, stuck on a tricky bit of code, 9 times out of 10 the solution usually comes to me when I'm 2 miles from the house and can't test it out!
